* 2 August 2018: Polybench updated to 4.2.1 version (only change was "syr2k" kernel)

(Still) TODO: check all benchmark with a verifier code to ensure that the kernel gets the same result than their C counterpart



*** Remark:
 - Symmetric/triangular matrices are stored in a triangular fashion (in the opposite of the C benchmark, where the full matrix is stored).
 	This is fine right now because of AlphaZ code generator which allocates the whole bounding box.
 	However, if this is optimised, we should decide about if we want a good Alphabets implementation (triangular allocation) or
 		an implementation comparable to the C one (rectangular allocation)
